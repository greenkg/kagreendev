Yep, summer classes are a struggle right now. I tried to sit down and get all the assignments organized in an excel sheet, so I can at least use that as a quick reference when looking to the week / day ahead. Mostly, I'm just trying to successfully submit everything by the day it's due. I normally like to work a little ahead, but haven't been able to get out ahead of this at all.

The classes I'm taking are:

* PHYS 2211K - Principles of Physics I (with lab)
* CSC 1301 - Principles of Computer Science I
* MATH 2212 - Calculus of One Variable II


Physics feels like the big problem. It has a lot of assignments, plus the lab, but the issue is that after spending all that time on the assignments I still don't feel like I "get" it.

Calculus takes almost as long to do the practice problems, but I can feel myself making progress and mastering the topics as I spend the time on it.

So I've decided to treat physics class like an experiment to see if there's a more efficient approach to learning the material. Since spending a lot of time on reading the book plus watching lectures doesn't seem to be clicking, I'm going to try spending a little less time on those (either only reading book thoroughly, or only watching lectures thoroughly, but not trying to do both in depth) and then more time on practice problems after each chapter *section* (instead of waiting until the end of each unit to do problems, like how our assignments are set up.)
