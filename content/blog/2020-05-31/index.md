It's looking like a busy summer. I'm taking:

* PHYS 2211K - Principles of Physics I (with lab)
* CSC 1301 - Principles of Computer Science I
* MATH 2212 - Calculus of One Variable II


I'm considering applying as a transfer student to GA Tech after fall semester, and CS 1301, PHYS 2211, and MATH 2212 are all prerequisite courses to transfer into Tech as a CS major. I'll need to take PHYS 2212 in the fall, so if I didn't take the first class this summer, I'd have to take one fall and one in spring before being able to apply to GA Tech. That was my original plan, but since classes are 100% online this summer, and I need to spend time commuting to campus (or to my clients), I figured I'd tried to squeeze them all in. If it's too much, well I just have to keep up with it for 7 weeks.
