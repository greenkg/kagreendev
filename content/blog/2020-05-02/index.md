Spring semester has finished, and I'm just waiting on professors to post final grades.

This semester's classes:
- HIST 2110 US History
- HIST 1112 World History since 1500
- MATH 2211 Calculus of One Variable

Due to complications getting a transcript a study abroad semester from my undergrad, GSU seriously delayed accepting my application. By the time I heard I was accepted (mid-December 2019), there were only a few weeks before classes started, and no placement tests offered until after the new year, since the University was already shut down for the holidays.

All that I really missed out on was being able to get a spot in CS 1301 -- GSU's intro to computer science. I managed to take a math placement test a couple days before spring registration closed, allowing me to test into Calc I.

Being a transfer student a decade after undergrad led to some weird things.

I took AP calculus in high school, so I didn't need to take it for my first undergrad. However, AP credits expire, so as far as GSU was concerned, I had no math credits. Which is fine--I didn't remember any calculus at all, so I needed to take it again. But I first had to prove I didn't have to take pre-calc or algebra again.

Next, GSU has these history requirements, which are a bit odd, because my first degree was at UGA (another GA public university), so you'd think that their history requirements would be the same as GSU's. I think if I end up being able to transfer to GA Tech, they won't require one of these two history classes.

### MATH 2211 Calculus of One Variable
Book: Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart
Covered: Chapters 2 through 5

### HIST 2110: Survey of US History
Book: The American Promise by James L. Roark
Covered: The whole thing, so long

### HIST 1112: Survey of World History since 1500
Book: None -- Course consisted of video lectures and Tableau tutorials
I liked that the course taught us to use Tableau to analyze historical data. Very rudimentary.
